## **Introduction**
This repo contains the official PyTorch implementation of DLAS-Net, a dual-level anomaly synthesis network for self-supervised anomaly detection in display, with a particular focus on weak anomalies (small, low-contrast, or locally non-uniform textures). 

We also release our self-built dataset, AnoLCD, together with training and evaluation scripts to enable reproducible experiments. The table below reports the overall performance of **DLAS-Net** on **AnoLCD**.

| I-AUROC â†‘ | I-AP â†‘ | I-RPT@95TPR â†“ | P-AUROC â†‘ | P-AP â†‘ | P-RPT@95TPR â†“ |
|:---------:|:------:|:-------------:|:---------:|:------:|:-------------:|
| **99.4%** |**99.7%**| **2.6%**     | **98.6%** |  **88.0%**  | **4.4%** |


## **Highlight**

- Proposed a dual-level anomaly synthesis framework for LCD weak defect detection.
- Designed an image-level synthesis method to generate anomalies with diverse shapes and visibility
- Developed a feature-level synthesis method to produce subtle and weak anomalies
- Released the first LCD anomaly detection dataset for public benchmarking

## **Installation**

```bash
conda create -n dlas python=3.9 -y
conda activate dlas
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```


## **Dataset**

### **Self-built datasets (AnoLCD)**


The dataset spans nine display screen categories, enabling comprehensive anomaly perception. It contains **2,450 normal** images and **750 anomalous** images. Of the normal images, **2,100** are used for training and **350** for testing.  
The anomaly set includes **250 spots**, **150 lines**, **50 mura**, **200 cylinders**, and **100 scratches**â€”**all anomaly images are used for testing**. Each image has a resolution of **1000Ã—1000** pixels.

Representative examples are shown below: **(a)â€“(e)** correspond to **cylinder, line, mura, scratch,** and **spot** defects, respectively; **(f)** shows the **average proportion of pixels covered by defect masks** for each defect type. These defects primarily exhibit **low contrast, small size,** and **local non-uniformity**.

### **Other public datasets**


To evaluate the generalization of our method on both **weak anomalies** and **texture anomalies**, we conduct experiments on two public datasets:

- **MAD-sys** â€” A dataset targeting weak anomalies in complex industrial scenarios.  
  **Download:** https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/

- **MVTec-tex** â€” A texture benchmark (subset of MVTec-AD) for detecting and localizing defects in homogeneous textures.

> Please follow the licenses and usage terms of the respective datasets.



## **Run**
